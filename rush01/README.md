# Rush01

In this project we will create a program that receives the clues for Skyscrappers's Puzzle and prints the solution.
The minimum puzzle size is 4x4, with bonus to go up till 9x9.

Currently, the program only works for 4x4.
We implemented our project using a backtracking algorithm and recursion. The code systematically explores possible solutions, starting from 1 and checking each number against the given conditions. If a condition is met, the number is placed in the grid; otherwise, the program backtracks to the previous step to explore alternative possibilities before proceeding


## Final grade: 42%
The project passed the evaluator with all edge cases checked and no memory leaks.
However, a member failed the explanation part, hence the result.
