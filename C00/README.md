# C00

In this project, we will explore the fundamental structure of C programs and functions. We'll cover variable types, control structures such as loops and conditional statements, and the usage of the 'Write' function. Additionally, we'll gain a basic understanding of ASCII table characters. All main functions have been commented out as per the given instructions.


## Final grade: 70%
All exercises have passed Moulinette, except ex07 and ex08. Ex07 and ex08 were done after the Piscine.
