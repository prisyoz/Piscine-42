# Piscine-42
C 42 subjects

Piscine 42 is a 26-day selection bootcamp for the common core at 42 school. It focuses on mastering C programming, algorithms, and problem-solving through hands-on, project-based learning in a peer-driven environment.

Always trust yourself to figure out the questions first. <br>
Then ask your left neighbour.<br>
Followed by your right neighbour.<br>
How about the person behind you?<br>
Or the person in front of you?<br>
If all else fails, there's always Google.<br>
Lastly, **RTFM**!! <br>

Some of the exercises posted were completed during the Piscine, while others are in progress as I continue to work through the remaining exercises from the bootcamp.
